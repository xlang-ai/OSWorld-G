COMPONENT_PROMPT = """Create a single React component that implements: {component_desc}

Rules:
1. Only provide the component's JavaScript code
2. No CSS imports, and MUI is the only library allowed
3. Component must be a functional component
4. Export the component as default

Format your response as JSON:
{{

ACTION_PROMPT = """Generate a PyAutoGUI function to interact with a UI component shown in the screenshot.

Input Information:
1. Action Description: {action_desc}
2. Component Description: {component_desc}
3. Screenshot: An image showing the component's current state
4. Position: The position of the elements in the screenshot, {position}

Task Analysis Process:
1. First identify the key points in the UI that won't change with parameters, for example:
   - For a slider: identify the left and right endpoints
   - For a button: identify its center position
   - For a text box: identify its corners or control points
   You can use the position information to help you identify these key points' position. 
   Note that you should generate these key points in the format of x_name, y_name = x, y. 
   x and y of the same key point should appear together in the same line.

2. Then identify the parameters from the action description:
   - Parameters are marked with <param_name> in the description
   - These will become function parameters
   - Example: "<volume>" in "set volume to <volume>%"

Requirements:
1. Function name must be "action"
2. Define constant coordinates for key UI points first
3. Use parameters from action description as function parameters
4. Include detailed explanation in thought_process

Example Scenarios:

1. Action Description: "Set volume to <volume>%"
   Component Description: "A volume slider"
   Screenshot: An image showing the volume slider
   Position: ```

   thought_process:
   - Identify the left and right endpoints of the slider using the position information:
     - The left endpoint is (22, 30)
     - The right endpoint is (222, 30)
   - Use the volume parameter to calculate the click position
   action_code:
   def action(volume):
       # Fixed points: slider endpoints
       x_0, y_0 = 22, 30     # Left endpoint of slider
       x_1, y_1 = 222, 30   # Right endpoint of slider
       
       # Calculate click position based on volume parameter
       x = x_0 + (x_1 - x_0) * (volume / 100)

There is no parameter for the click, since the location of this action is fixed.

DESC_PROMPT = """Generate a `component_description` for each component. The description should be detailed and accurately describe its appearance and composition so that a front-end engineer can write the corresponding code based solely on this description without adding any additional information. 

Example:
"A rating component with 5 stars, where 4 stars are selected by default",
"A volume control slider that allows users to adjust the volume by clicking or dragging",
"A PowerPoint-style text box where users can resize or move it by dragging its eight control points on edges and corners",

After the component description, generate a list of 3 `action_descs` for each action that can be performed on the component. 
You are encouraged to use parameters in the action description to describe the action. The parameters should be marked with <param_name> in the description.
You are encouraged to explore as many functions of the component as possible.

Example:
For "A rating component with 5 stars, where 4 stars are selected by default":
["Click on the 2nd star of the rating component to select it", "Click on the 4th star of the rating component to select it", "Give a 3 star rating"],

For "A volume control slider that allows users to adjust the volume by clicking or dragging":
["Click on the volume slider to set the volume to <x>%", "Increase the volume by <x>%", "Decrease the volume by <x>%"],

For "A PowerPoint-style text box where users can resize or move it by dragging its eight control points on edges and corners":
