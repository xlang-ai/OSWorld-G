Here's how you can easily transform a value in any range to a scale of 0 - 100:\n\n```jsx\n// MIN = Minimum expected value\n// MAX = Maximum expected value\n// Function to normalise the values (MIN / MAX could be integrated)\nconst normalise = (value) => ((value - MIN) * 100) / (MAX - MIN);\n\n// Example component that utilizes the `normalise` function at the point of render.\nfunction Progress(props) {\n  return (\n    <React.Fragment>\n      <CircularProgress variant=\"determinate\" value={normalise(props.value)} />\n      <LinearProgress variant=\"determinate\" value={normalise(props.value)} />\n    </React.Fragment>\n  );\n}\n```"
