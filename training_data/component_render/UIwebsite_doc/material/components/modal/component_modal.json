    "# Modal\n\n<p class=\"description\">The modal component provides a solid foundation for creating dialogs, popovers, lightboxes, or whatever else.</p>\n\nThe component renders its `children` node in front of a backdrop component.\nThe `Modal` offers important features:\n\n- üíÑ Manages modal stacking when one-at-a-time just isn't enough.\n- üîê Creates a backdrop, for disabling interaction below the modal.\n- üîê It disables scrolling of the page content while open.\n- ‚ôøÔ∏è It properly manages focus; moving to the modal content,\n  and keeping it there until the modal is closed.\n- ‚ôøÔ∏è Adds the appropriate ARIA roles automatically.\n\n\n\n:::info\nThe term \"modal\" is sometimes used to mean \"dialog\", but this is a misnomer.\nA modal window describes parts of a UI.\nAn element is considered modal if [it blocks interaction with the rest of the application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window).\n:::\n\nIf you are creating a modal dialog, you probably want to use the [Dialog](/material-ui/react-dialog/) component rather than directly using Modal.\nModal is a lower-level construct that is leveraged by the following components:\n\n- [Dialog](/material-ui/react-dialog/)\n- [Drawer](/material-ui/react-drawer/)\n- [Menu](/material-ui/react-menu/)\n- [Popover](/material-ui/react-popover/)"
