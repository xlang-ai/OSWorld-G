        "Run codemods\n\nThe `preset-safe` codemod will automatically adjust the bulk of your code to account for breaking changes in v6. You can run `v6.0.0/data-grid/preset-safe` targeting only Data Grid or `v6.0.0/preset-safe` to target Date and Time pickers as well.\n\nYou can either run it on a specific file, folder, or your entire codebase when choosing the `<path>` argument.\n\n```bash\n# Data Grid specific\nnpx @mui/x-codemod@latest v6.0.0/data-grid/preset-safe <path>\n\n# Target Date and Time Pickers as well\nnpx @mui/x-codemod@latest v6.0.0/preset-safe <path>\n```\n\n:::success\nApart from the removed methods and exports that require manual intervention, around 50% of the DataGrid breaking changes are automatically handled by the `preset-safe` codemod ðŸŽ‰.\n:::\n\n:::info\nIf you want to run the codemods one by one, check out the codemods included in the [preset-safe codemod for Data Grid](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/blob/master/packages/x-codemod/README.md#preset-safe-for-data-grid-v600) for more details.\n:::\n\nBreaking changes that are handled by `preset-safe` codemod are denoted by a âœ… emoji in the table of contents on the right side of the screen or next to the specific point that is handled by it.\n\nIf you have already applied the `v6.0.0/data-grid/preset-safe` (or `v6.0.0/preset-safe`) codemod, then you should not need to take any further action on these items. If there's a specific part of the breaking change that is not part of the codemod or needs some manual work, it will be listed in the end of each section.\n\nAll other changes must be handled manually.\n\n:::warning\nNot all use cases are covered by codemods. In some scenarios, like props spreading, cross-file dependencies, etc., the changes are not properly identified and therefore must be handled manually.\n\nFor example, if a codemod tries to rename a prop, but this prop is hidden with the spread operator, it won't be transformed as expected.\n\n```tsx\n<DataGrid {...newProps} />\n```\n\nAfter running the codemods, make sure to test your application and that you don't have any console errors.\n\nFeel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/new/choose) for support if you need help to proceed with your migration.\n:::"
