In some scenarios, like props spreading, cross-file dependencies, etc., the changes are not properly identified and therefore must be handled manually.\n\nFor example, if a codemod tries to rename a prop, but this prop is hidden with the spread operator, it won't be transformed as expected.\n\n```tsx\n<DataGrid {...newProps} />\n```\n\nAfter running the codemods, make sure to test your application and that you don't have any console errors.\n\nFeel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/new/choose) for support if you need help to proceed with your migration.\n:::"

            "Columns\n\n- The `GridColDef['type']` has been narrowed down to only accept the built-in column types.\n  TypeScript users need to use the `GridColDef` interface when defining columns:\n\n  ```tsx\n  // 🛑 `type` is inferred as `string` and is too wide\n  const columns = [{ type: 'number', field: 'id' }];\n  <DataGrid columns={columns} />;\n\n  // ✅ `type` is `'number'`\n  const columns: GridColDef[] = [{ type: 'number', field: 'id' }];\n  <DataGrid columns={columns} />;\n\n  // ✅ Alternalively, `as const` can be used to narrow down the type\n  const columns = [{ type: 'number' as const, field: 'id' }];\n  <DataGrid columns={columns} />;\n  ```\n\n- The type `GridPinnedColumns` has been renamed to `GridPinnedColumnFields`.\n\n- The type `GridPinnedPosition` has been renamed to `GridPinnedColumnPosition`.\n\n- The column grouping API methods `getColumnGroupPath` and `getAllGroupDetails` are no longer prefixed with `unstable_`.\n\n- The column grouping selectors `gridFocusColumnGroupHeaderSelector` and `gridTabIndexColumnGroupHeaderSelector` are no longer prefixed with `unstable_`.\n\n- The columns management component has been redesigned and the component is extracted from the `ColumnsPanel` which now only serves as a wrapper to display the component over the headers as a panel. As a result, a new slot `columnsManagement`, and corresponding prop `slotProps.columnsManagement` have been introduced. The props corresponding to the columns management component which were previously passed to the prop `slotProps.columnsPanel` should now be passed to `slotProps.columnsManagement`. `slotProps.columnsPanel` could still be used to override props corresponding to the `Panel` component used in `ColumnsPanel` which uses [`Popper`](/material-ui/react-popper/) component under the hood.\n\n```diff\n <DataGrid\n  slotProps={{\n-   columnsPanel: {\n+   columnsManagement: {\n      sort: 'asc',\n      autoFocusSearchField: false,\n    },\n  }}\n />\n```\n\n- `Show all` and `Hide all` buttons in the `ColumnsPanel` have been combined into one `Show/Hide All` checkbox in the new columns management component. The related props `disableShowAllButton` and `disableHideAllButton` have been replaced with a new prop `disableShowHideToggle`.\n\n- The signature of `GridColDef['valueGetter']` has been changed for performance reasons:\n\n  ```diff\n  -valueGetter: ({ value, row }) => value,\n  +valueGetter: (value, row, column, apiRef) => value,\n  ```\n\n  The `GridValueGetterParams` interface has been removed:\n\n  ```diff\n  -const customValueGetter = (params: GridValueGetterParams) => params.row.budget;\n  +const customValueGetter: GridValueGetterFn = (value, row) => row.budget;\n  ```\n\n- The signature of `GridColDef['valueFormatter']` has been changed for performance reasons:\n\n  ```diff\n  -valueFormatter: ({ value }) => value,\n  +valueFormatter: (value, row, column, apiRef) => value,\n  ```\n\n  The `GridValueFormatterParams` interface has been removed:\n\n  ```diff\n  -const gridDateFormatter = ({ value, field, id }: GridValueFormatterParams<Date>) => value.toLocaleDateString();\n  +const gridDateFormatter: GridValueFormatter = (value: Date) => value.toLocaleDateString();\n  ```\n\n- The signature of `GridColDef['valueSetter']` has been changed for performance reasons:\n\n  ```diff\n  -valueSetter: (params) => {\n  -  const [firstName, lastName] = params.value!.toString().split(' ');\n  -  return { ...params.row, firstName, lastName };\n  -}\n  +valueSetter: (value, row) => {\n  +  const [firstName, lastName] = value!.toString().split(' ');\n  +  return { ...row, firstName, lastName };\n  +}\n  ```\n\n  The `GridValueSetterParams` interface has been removed:\n\n  ```diff\n  -const setFullName = (params: GridValueSetterParams) => {\n  -  const [firstName, lastName] = params.value!.toString().split(' ');\n  -  return { ...params.row, firstName, lastName };\n  -};\n  +const setFullName: GridValueSetter<Row> = (value, row) => {\n  +  const [firstName, lastName] = value!.toString().split(' ');\n  +  return { ...row, firstName, lastName };\n  +}\n  ```\n\n- The signature of `GridColDef['valueParser']` has been changed for performance reasons:\n\n  ```diff\n  -valueParser: (value, params: GridCellParams) => value.toLowerCase(),\n  +valueParser: (value, row, column, apiRef) => value.toLowerCase(),\n  ```\n\n- The signature of `GridColDef['colSpan']` has been changed for performance reasons:\n\n  ```diff\n  -colSpan: ({ row, field, value }: GridCellParams) => (row.id === 'total' ? 2 : 1),\n  +colSpan: (value, row, column, apiRef) => (row.id === 'total' ? 2 : 1),\n  ```\n\n- The signature of `GridColDef['pastedValueParser']` has been changed for performance reasons:\n\n  ```diff\n  -pastedValueParser: (value, params) => new Date(value),\n  +pastedValueParser: (value, row, column, apiRef) => new Date(value),\n  ```\n\n- The signature of `GridColDef['groupingValueGetter']` has been changed for performance reasons:\n\n  ```diff\n  -groupingValueGetter: (params) => params.value.name,\n  +groupingValueGetter: (value: { name: string }, row, column, apiRef) => value.name,\n  ```"

In order to override some props corresponding to the toolbar buttons or their corresponding tooltips, you can use the `slotProps` prop. Following is an example diff. See [Toolbar section](/x/react-data-grid/components/#toolbar) for more details.\n\n```diff\n function CustomToolbar() {\n  return (\n    <GridToolbarContainer>\n      <GridToolbarColumnsButton />\n      <GridToolbarFilterButton\n-       title=\"Custom filter\" // 🛑 This was previously forwarded to the tooltip component\n+       slotProps={{ tooltip: { title: 'Custom filter' } }} // ✅ This is the correct way now\n      />\n      <GridToolbarDensitySelector\n-       variant=\"outlined\"    // 🛑 This was previously forwarded to the button component\n+       slotProps={{ button: { variant: 'outlined' } }} // ✅ This is the correct way now\n      />\n    </GridToolbarContainer>\n  );\n }\n```"

You can add `display: 'flex'` on the column definition to restore the behavior.\n\n  **NOTE**: If you're using **dynamic row height**, this also means cells aren't vertically centered by default anymore, you might want to set the `display: 'flex'` for all non-dynamic columns. This may also affect text-ellipsis, which you can restore by adding your own wrapper with `text-overflow: ellipsis`.\n\n  ```tsx\n  {\n    display: 'flex',\n    renderCell: ({ value }) => (\n      <div style={{ overflow: 'hidden', textOverflow: 'ellipsis' }}>\n        {value}\n      </div>\n    ),\n  },\n  ```\n\n- The `columnHeader--showColumnBorder` class was replaced by `columnHeader--withLeftBorder` and `columnHeader--withRightBorder`.\n- The `columnHeadersInner`, `columnHeadersInner--scrollable`, and `columnHeaderDropZone` classes were removed since the inner wrapper was removed in our effort to simplify the DOM structure and improve accessibility.\n- The `pinnedColumnHeaders`, `pinnedColumnHeaders--left`, and `pinnedColumnHeaders--right` classes have been removed along with the element they were applied to.\n  The pinned column headers now use `position: 'sticky'` and are rendered in the same row element as the regular column headers.\n- The column headers and pinned section now require an explicit color. By default, the MUI `theme.palette.background.default` color will be used. To customize it, see https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/palette/#customization\n  We will be adding a new color name to the palette for additional customization, read [#12443](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/12443) for more details."
