        "Run codemods\n\nThe `preset-safe` codemod will automatically adjust the bulk of your code to account for breaking changes in v8. You can run `v8.0.0/charts/preset-safe` targeting only Charts or `v8.0.0/preset-safe` to target the other packages as well.\n\nYou can either run it on a specific file, folder, or your entire codebase when choosing the `<path>` argument.\n\n<!-- #default-branch-switch -->\n\n```bash\n# Charts-specific\nnpx @mui/x-codemod@latest v8.0.0/charts/preset-safe <path>\n\n# Target the other packages as well\nnpx @mui/x-codemod@latest v8.0.0/preset-safe <path>\n```\n\n:::info\nIf you want to run the transformers one by one, check out the transformers included in the [preset-safe codemod for the Charts](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/blob/HEAD/packages/x-codemod/README.md#preset-safe-for-charts-v800) for more details.\n:::\n\nBreaking changes that are handled by this codemod are denoted by a ✅ emoji in the table of contents on the right side of the screen.\n\nIf you have already applied the `v8.0.0/charts/preset-safe` (or `v8.0.0/preset-safe`) codemod, then you should not need to take any further action on these items.\n\nAll other changes must be handled manually.\n\n:::warning\nNot all use cases are covered by codemods. In some scenarios, like props spreading or cross-file dependencies, the changes are not properly identified and therefore must be handled manually.\n\nFor example, if a codemod tries to rename a prop, but this prop is hidden with the spread operator, it won't be transformed as expected.\n\n```tsx\n<PieChart {...chartProps} /> // The codemod will not modify the content of `chartProps`.\n```\n\nAfter running the codemods, make sure to test your application and that you don't have any console errors.\n\nFeel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/new/choose) for support if you need help to proceed with your migration.\n:::"
