      "introduction": [
        "Updating the loading mode\n\nThe Grid changes the loading mode dynamically if the total row count gets updated by changing the `rowCount` prop, returning different `rowCount` in `GridGetRowsResponse` or via `setRowCount()` API.\n\nBased on the previous and the new value for the total row count, the following scenarios are possible:\n\n- **Unknown `rowCount` to known `rowCount`**: When the row count is set to a valid value from an unknown value, the Data Grid switches to viewport loading mode. It checks the number of already fetched rows and adds skeleton rows to match the provided row count.\n\n- **Known `rowCount` to unknown `rowCount`**: If the row count is updated and set to `-1`, the Data Grid resets, fetches the first page, then sets itself to infinite loading mode.\n\n- **Known `rowCount` greater than the actual row count**: This can happen either by reducing the value of the row count after more rows were already fetched, or if the row count was unknown and the Grid (while in the infinite loading mode) already fetched more rows. In this case, the Grid resets, fetches the first page, and then continues in one mode or the other depending on the new value of the `rowCount`.\n\n:::warning\n`rowCount` is expected to be static.\nChanging its value can cause the Grid to reset and the cache to be cleared which may lead to performance and UX degradation.\n:::\n\nThe demo below serves as a showcase of the behavior described above, and is not representative of something you would implement in a real-world scenario."
