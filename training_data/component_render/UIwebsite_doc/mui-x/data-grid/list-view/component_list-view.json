While you can use this feature in production, the API could change in the future.\n:::\n\nList view can be enabled by providing the `unstable_listView` prop.\n\nUnlike the default grid view, the list view makes no assumptions on how data is presented to end users.\n\nIn order to display data in a list view, a `unstable_listColumn` prop must be provided with a `renderCell` function.\n\n```tsx\nfunction ListViewCell(params: GridRenderCellParams) {\n  return <>{params.row.id}</>;\n}\n\nconst listColDef: GridListColDef = {\n  field: 'listColumn',\n  renderCell: ListViewCell,\n};\n\n<DataGridPro unstable_listColumn={listColDef} unstable_listView={true} />;\n```"
