        "If no such unique identifier exists in the data set, then you must create it by some other means, but this scenario should be avoided because it leads to issues with other features of the Data Grid.\n\nNote that it is not necessary to create a column to display the unique identifier data.\nThe Data Grid pulls this information directly from the data set itself, not from anything displayed on the screen.\n\n:::warning\nJust like the `rows` prop, the `getRowId` function should keep the same JavaScript reference between two renders.\nOtherwise, the Data Grid will re-apply heavy work like sorting and filtering.\n\nIt could be achieved by either defining the prop outside the component scope or by memoizing using the `React.useCallback` hook if the function reuses something from the component scope.\n:::"
