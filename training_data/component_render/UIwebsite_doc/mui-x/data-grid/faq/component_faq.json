        "How to pass props to the Data Grid for better performance?\n\nThe Data Grid is a complex component that renders a lot of elements. As a general rule, all the non-primitive props should keep a stable reference between renders to avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n\nThis is especially important for the `columns` prop. The columns are designed to be definitions, to never change once the component is mounted. Otherwise, you take the risk of losing elements like column width or order.\n\nThis can be achieved by one of the following ways:\n\n1. If the columns do not depend on something within the component scope, you can define them outside of the component and pass them as a prop.\n\n   ```tsx\n   const columns = [\n     { field: 'id' },\n     { field: 'firstName' },\n     { field: 'lastName' },\n     { field: 'age' },\n     { field: 'fullName' },\n   ];\n\n   function App() {\n     return <DataGrid columns={columns} {...other} />;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. If the columns require something within the component scope, like a state value or a prop, you can use the `useMemo` hook to keep a stable reference between renders.\n\n   ```tsx\n   function App(props) {\n     const renderCell = React.useCallback(\n       (params) => {\n         return (\n           <strong>\n             {params.value} {props.someValue}\n           </strong>\n         );\n       },\n       [props.someValue],\n     );\n\n     const columns = React.useMemo(\n       () => [\n         { field: 'id' },\n         { field: 'firstName' },\n         { field: 'lastName' },\n         { field: 'age' },\n         { field: 'fullName', renderCell },\n       ],\n       [renderCell],\n     );\n\n     return <DataGrid columns={columns} {...other} />;\n   }\n   ```"

          "introduction": [
            "`renderCell`\n\nIt is the most powerful way to customize the content of a cell. It allows you to render anything you want inside the cell. It is the only way to render a React component inside a cell. It is also the only way to customize the cell's behavior (for instance, add a click handler). It is the most flexible way to customize a cell, but it is also the most expensive one. It should be used only when the other options are not enough.\n\nHere's an example for a cell that displays a button:\n\n```tsx\nconst columns: GridColDef[] = [\n  {\n    field: 'date',\n    headerName: 'Year',\n    renderCell: (params: GridRenderCellParams<any, Date>) => (\n      <strong>\n        {params.value.getFullYear()}\n        <Button\n          variant=\"contained\"\n          size=\"small\"\n          style={{ marginLeft: 16 }}\n          tabIndex={params.hasFocus ? 0 : -1}\n        >\n          Open\n        </Button>\n      </strong>\n    ),\n  },\n];\n```\n\nSee more about the `renderCell` method in the [rendering cells](/x/react-data-grid/column-definition/#rendering-cells) section."

            "`valueGetter`\n\nIt is a function that allows you to derive the cell value from the row data. It is the most performant way to customize the cell content. It is also the only way to customize the cell value without changing the row data. It should be used when you need to derive the cell value from the row data. Common use cases are:\n\n- Transforming the value (for example convert a decimal value to a percentage value)\n- Deriving the value from multiple fields (for example concatenating first name and last name)\n- Deriving the value from a nested field (for example `user.address.city`)\n\nThis value is also used internally in the Grid to filter, sort, and render (if no `renderCell` or `valueFormatter` is provided). You can learn more about it in the [value getter](/x/react-data-grid/column-definition/#value-getter) section."
