    "# Data Grid - Row pinning [<span class=\"plan-pro\"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan 'Pro plan')\n\n<p class=\"description\">Pin rows to keep them visible at all times.</p>\n\nPinned (or frozen, locked, or floating) rows are those visible at all times while the user scrolls the Data Grid vertically.\n\nYou can pin rows at the top or bottom of the Data Grid by passing pinned rows data through the `pinnedRows` prop:\n\n```tsx\nconst pinnedRows: GridPinnedRowsProp = {\n  top: [{ id: 0, brand: 'Nike' }],\n  bottom: [\n    { id: 1, brand: 'Adidas' },\n    { id: 2, brand: 'Puma' },\n  ],\n};\n\n<DataGridPro pinnedRows={pinnedRows} />;\n```\n\nThe data format for pinned rows is the same as for the `rows` prop (see [Feeding data](/x/react-data-grid/row-definition/#feeding-data)).\n\nPinned rows data should also meet [Row identifier](/x/react-data-grid/row-definition/#row-identifier) requirements.",
    ":::warning\nJust like the `rows` prop, `pinnedRows` prop should keep the same reference between two renders.\nOtherwise, the Data Grid will re-apply heavy work like sorting and filtering.\n:::"
